# Monastery Framework for Game Maker Studio 2
A framework for Game Maker 2.0 with many useful functions and objects

The main objective with this framework is to give a jump start to the basic things that all games usually have: interface, options menu, music, sound, ini files, etc.

As long as you can use the sprites and objects as they are, I encourage you to change them to give your game a distinct face. I left customizeable variables on the Create event of all objects.

You can use it in all your games for free. Just credit me, Kezarus and put a link to my Twitter (https://twitter.com/CesarOttani), in your final product.

The name is because when I was starting to develop my games  I usually put gregorian chant music to play. Nowadays a put from metal to blues, sometimes chant music. =]
